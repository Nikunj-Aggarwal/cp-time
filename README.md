### ‚ú® Demo [![cp-time-demo.gif](https://s2.gifyu.com/images/cp-time-demo.gif)](https://gifyu.com/image/Ud76)

## Features

```sh
1. Timer will start just after rendering of the problem page.
2. Single Click on timer to stop and resume it. (Use it whenever you need a break while solving a problem)
3. Double click to reset the timer.
4. Double click and hold the timer to drag it, Release the click to place it. (You can put the timer wherever you feel comfortable with it. By default, its position is at bottom left.
5. I kept the UI minimalistic and plain so that user do not get distracted by it.
```

## Usage

```sh
1. You can record and monitor your problem solving speed and can eventually improve it by taking necessary actions. Practicising this approach can shoot up your rankings on cp platforms. 
2. Helps a lot in interview preparations.
3. Keeps you active during problem solving sessions. 
4. Sometimes, we give unnecessarily more time to a question without realising. You can choose your time limit (mine is 20 - 40 mins depend on the toughness of question). Simply see the editorial/approach after that time limit.
```
